# Double Slit Simulations with Coherent and Incoherent Light

These are finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations of the double slit experiment with coherent light, incoherent light and partially coherent light.

The simulations are performed at three different time scales: femtoseconds, picoseconds and microseconds to show the differences between them.

The simulations use the [open source FDTD meep simulator](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The simulations are stored in [HDF5](https://www.h5py.org/) file format which is very good to store large amounts of data.
Then, the simulation are represented and animated with matplotlib.

Check the [article](https://rafael-fuente.github.io/visual-explanation-of-the-van-cittert-zernike-theorem-the-double-slit-experiment-with-incoherent-and-coherent-light.html) and the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cyzdsd6AOs&list=PLYkZehxPE_IhJDMTJUob1ZbxWhL8AjHDi&index=2) for further explanation of the simulations.

The fastest simulations are the femtoseconds, you can complete them in two minutes.

For the microseconds simulations, you need to run the simulation at least with 10000 samples and averaging them to get a denoised image. This task could take several hours in a personal computer. The smartest approach is taking a sample each time interval equal to the coherence time of the source: λ * λ / (c * Δλ). This is because it is the minimum time to make the electric field change considerably.
