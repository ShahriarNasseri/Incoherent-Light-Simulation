# Incoherent-Light-Simulation


This simulator works computing the field created by point sources with random phases and randomly placed inside a circle. 

Time averaging is done using Monte Carlo integration. 

Then, the simulation is represented and animated with matplotlib.

## Installation

Just clone or download this repo.
The package requeriments are:

1. numpy
2. matplotlib
3. progressbar

## Simulations

To perform the simulations, just run from the command prompt the corresponding Python scripts:

```
python simulation_femtoseconds.py
```

[![animation](/images/femtoseconds_sim.gif)](/simulation_femtoseconds.py)


```
python simulation_picoseconds.py
```

```
python simulation_microseconds.py
```
