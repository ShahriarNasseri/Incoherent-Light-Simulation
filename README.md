# Incoherent-Light-Simulation


This simulator works computing the field created by point sources with random phases and randomly placed inside a circle. 

Time averaging is done using Monte Carlo integration. 

Then, the simulation is represented and animated with matplotlib.

```
python simulation_femtoseconds.py
```
